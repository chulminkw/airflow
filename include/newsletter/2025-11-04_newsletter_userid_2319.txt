Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 19.1°C, but it will feel more like 18.7°C. The relative humidity is 74%.
As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today,
take these three quotes with you:
1. "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.  " - Seneca
2. "Follow the man who seeks the truth; run from the man who has found it." - Vaclav Havel
3. "Sometimes success isn't about making the right decision, it's more about making some decision." - Robin Sharma
Have a fantastic journey!
